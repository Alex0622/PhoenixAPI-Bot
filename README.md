# PhoenixAPI-Bot
PhoenixAPI is a bot developed with discord.js. The main reason of this bot is the managment for [exaroton](https://exaroton.com/) servers using the exaroton API.
You can find the documentation about the exaroton API [here](https://support.exaroton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011926177-API-documentation) and its package [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/exaroton).

# Using the bot
This is a private bot but if you want to use it I have uploaded an example file with its main and config file.
In the config file you can change the bot's prefix; add the exaroton API key which will be needed to get the information about your servers and account on exaroton; you will also find the Discord API token which is required to run the bot; also, the ID of the general channel which is used when the bot goes online and sends a message saying hi. And if you want to change the color of the embed you can do that in the config.json file.

# Commands
Information about the bot and its commands can be found using the `API help` command.
